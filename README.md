# Chicken Picker Angular Client

## Description

This app allows user to view different breeds of chickens, learn about their class listing according to the American Poultry Association, and see what the general properties of the breeds are.

Users can also add and remove breeds from their favorites list as well as search for specific breeds by name.

This is a front-end client made to connect to a custom REST API located [here.](https://github.com/nickplamb/Chickens_api)

This app was created using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) with documentation using [typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)
